# Fractal Central Backflow – Core Mechanism in KGT v4.4

**Date:** 2025-12-23  
**Version:** KGT v4.4  
**Status:** Implemented and validated

## Overview

In the center of a fractal vortex system, the increasing density of overlapping vortices leads to the formation of counter-rotating, compensatory structures. These emergent geometries dampen gravitational forces locally and are intrinsically connected to larger-scale energy flows via the fractal structure of space.

Within the **Königsmann Theory**, dark matter does not obey classical inertial constraints but instead propagates along **fractal resonance paths**, enabling **super-resonant, system-wide mass redistribution**. These processes occur in a time-independent manner, ensuring that **no persistent overdensity forms in the central region** of a galactic system.

## Code Integration (KGT v4.4)

Earlier versions of the numerical model did not yet include this fractal damping in the center, which resulted in overly high rotation velocities at small radii.

Starting from **KGT v4.4**, the central backflow has been implemented through a radius-dependent damping function that reflects the **fractal counter-vortex effect**. This now produces a physically plausible match across both inner and outer radii, preserving the outer plateau while correcting the core overshoot.
