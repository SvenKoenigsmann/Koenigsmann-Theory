# Fractal Central Backflow – Core Mechanism in KGT v4.4

**Date:** 2025-12-23  
**Version:** KGT v4.4  
**Status:** Implemented and documented

## Overview

In the center of a fractal vortex system, the increasing density of overlapping vortices naturally generates **counter-rotating, compensatory structures**.  
These emergent counter-vortices:

- reduce local gravitational amplification,  
- redistribute energetic stress along higher-order fractal pathways,  
- prevent long-term mass accumulation in the galactic core.

Within the **Königsmann Theory**, dark matter acts as a **non-inertial, Φ-scaled feedback medium**, capable of redistributing mass-energy through **fractal resonance paths**.  
These paths allow **scale-dependent super-resonant propagation** (not classical “superluminal speed”, but a faster effective propagation on deeper fractal layers), enabling a *time-independent* equilibration of central overdensities.

As a consequence:  
➡️ **A galactic center cannot maintain a persistent overdensity**, because the fractal backflow continuously drains excess curvature into the surrounding structure.

## Code Integration in KGT v4.4

Earlier numerical versions (v3.x and early v4.x) did not yet include a full representation of this central fractal backflow, leading to **overpredicted rotation velocities** at radii below ~5 kpc.

Beginning with **KGT v4.4**, the model now incorporates:

- a radius-dependent **core damping term**,  
- reflecting the counter-vortex structure in the inner region,  
- consistent with the fractal feedback dynamics described in the theory.

This addition corrects the inner overshoot while **preserving the stable outer plateau**, leading to a more accurate fit of the Andromeda rotation curve across all radii.

## Theoretical Reference

The physical mechanism implemented here is **already described** in the formal Königsmann Theory document:

### **Koenigsmann_Theory_For_arXiv.pdf**

Relevant theoretical sections include:

- **Section 5 — Transition Zone Dynamics**  
  (macro–quantum coupling, time compression in vortex centers)

- **Section 6 — Dark Matter as a Fractal Feedback System**  
  (non-local redistribution along Φ-scaled resonance paths)

- **Appendix B — Scale-Dependent Propagation in the Fractal Hierarchy**  
  (effective “super-resonant” transfer enabling rapid equilibration)

These sections together constitute the **formal theoretical basis**  
for the central backflow implemented in KGT v4.4.
