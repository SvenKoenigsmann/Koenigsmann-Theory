## 📘 Overview

The Königsman Theory (KGT) proposes a unified geometric model of gravitational behavior based on  

- **fractal Φ-scaling (Golden Ratio symmetry),**  
- **vortex-driven curvature dynamics**,  
- **ψ-backflow fields**,  
- and **non-linear density evolution Λ₍fractal₎(t)**.  

The framework aims to address several open questions in modern astrophysics and cosmology, including:

- Galaxy rotation curves without exotic dark matter halos  
- CP-violating matter distribution and large-scale structure formation  
- Time–gravity coupling within vortex-curved geometries  
- Macroscopic “tunneling-like” behavior and gravitational field displacement  

This repository provides the full scientific package for independent review, verification, and further development.
